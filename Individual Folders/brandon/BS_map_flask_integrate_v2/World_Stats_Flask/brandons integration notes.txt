break code into 3 sections 
	map draw
	map color
	map legend 
	map info 

see if you can add a button to color the map differently 
based on gdp versus pop 

if that works then start testing with flask 
feeding the country selected on mouse click as the country to the info box

also the country name is not correct - pull in different field from geo json as  
look at Argentina
